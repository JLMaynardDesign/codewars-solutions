/*
Your task is to make two functions (max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language) that receive a list of integers as input and return, respectively, the largest and lowest number in that list.
Examples (Input -> Output)

* [4,6,2,1,9,63,-134,566]         -> max = 566, min = -134
* [-52, 56, 30, 29, -54, 0, -110] -> min = -110, max = 56
* [42, 54, 65, 87, 0]             -> min = 0, max = 87
* [5]                             -> min = 5, max = 5

Notes

    You may consider that there will not be any empty arrays/vectors.

*/

//my solution

var min = function(list){
  let output = Math.min(...list);
  return output;
};

var max = function(list){
  let output = Math.max(...list);
  return output;
};
